**Status:** üöß In Progress
**Priority:** High
**Target:** Complete core functionality improvements
**Date:** 2025-10-17

---

## üìã Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed (from previous milestone)
- [x] Real GitHub data integration (100 marketplaces, 2,226+ stars)
- [x] Data pipeline and marketplace scanner
- [x] Browser testing infrastructure
- [x] Foundation for marketplace detail pages
- [x] Dynamic statistics display

### üöß In Progress
- [x] Marketplace detail pages updated to use real data
- [ ] Plugin extraction from marketplace manifests (runtime errors)
- [ ] Popular Plugins section functionality

### ‚ùå Issues to Fix
- [x] Homepage shows real statistics (100 marketplaces, 2,226 stars)
- [ ] Marketplace cards still show mock data instead of real data
- [ ] Popular Plugins section shows 0 plugins
- [ ] Marketplace detail pages have runtime rendering errors

---

## üéØ High Priority Tasks

### 1. Fix Plugin Extraction Runtime Errors
**Problem:** Plugin extraction logic causes React to not render
**Files:** `src/pages/index.tsx`, `src/pages/marketplaces/[id].tsx`
**Impact:** Critical - blocks core functionality

**Steps:**
- [ ] Debug runtime errors in plugin extraction loop
- [ ] Add proper error handling for malformed plugin data
- [ ] Test with smaller subset of marketplaces
- [ ] Ensure React rendering continues even with partial data

### 2. Fix Marketplace Cards Display
**Problem:** Homepage shows 22 marketplace cards (mock) instead of real data
**File:** `src/pages/index.tsx`
**Root Cause:** `marketplaces` variable fallback logic issue

**Steps:**
- [ ] Debug why `marketplaceData?.marketplaces` not working in UI
- [ ] Check data structure compatibility with MarketplaceCard component
- [ ] Ensure proper transformation from API data to component props

### 3. Complete Navigation Links
**Problem:** "View All marketplaces" and "View All plugins" links are 404s
**Files:** Need to create listing pages

**Steps:**
- [ ] Create `/marketplaces` page with full marketplace listing
- [ ] Create `/plugins` page with full plugin listing
- [ ] Add pagination and filtering to listing pages
- [ ] Update navigation components

---

## üîß Medium Priority Tasks

### 4. Enhance Marketplace Detail Pages
**File:** `src/pages/marketplaces/[id].tsx`
**Issues:** Runtime errors prevent rendering

**Steps:**
- [ ] Debug React rendering failures in detail pages
- [ ] Ensure proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add loading states for data fetching
- [ ] Test with multiple marketplace examples

### 5. Improve Analytics Dashboard
**File:** `/admin/analytics` page
**Status:** Unknown if functional

**Steps:**
- [ ] Test analytics dashboard functionality
- [ ] Verify data sources and calculations
- [ ] Add real-time metrics from marketplace data
- [ ] Implement caching for performance

### 6. Expand GitHub Search
**Current:** 100 marketplaces (first page only)
**Potential:** Up to 1,000 marketplaces (all pages)

**Steps:**
- [ ] Modify scanner to paginate through all 10 pages
- [ ] Add multiple search queries for broader coverage
- [ ] Implement rate limit handling for larger scans
- [ ] Consider automated update scheduling

---

## üé® UI/UX Improvements

### 7. Enhanced Search and Filtering
**Files:** Multiple page components

**Features to Add:**
- [ ] Real-time search across marketplaces and plugins
- [ ] Category filtering with actual plugin categories
- [ ] Sorting by stars, updated date, plugin count
- [ ] Tag-based filtering

### 8. Performance Optimizations
**Areas for Improvement:**
- [ ] Implement proper data caching
- [ ] Add loading states and skeletons
- [ ] Optimize bundle size for marketplace data
- [ ] Add client-side pagination

---

## üîç Testing & Quality Assurance

### 9. Comprehensive Testing
**Files:** `scripts/browser-test.ts` and more

**Test Coverage Needed:**
- [ ] Plugin extraction with various manifest formats
- [ ] Marketplace detail page functionality
- [ ] Navigation flows between pages
- [ ] Error handling for missing/malformed data

### 10. Error Handling & Edge Cases
**Scenarios to Handle:**
- [ ] Missing manifest files
- [ ] Malformed plugin data
- [ ] GitHub API rate limits
- [ ] Network failures
- [ ] Empty result sets

## üìä Success Metrics

### Functionality Goals
- [ ] Homepage displays real marketplace cards (not mock data)
- [ ] Popular Plugins section shows actual plugins from manifests
- [ ] All navigation links work correctly
- [ ] Individual marketplace pages render without errors

### Performance Goals
- [ ] Page load times under 3 seconds
- [ ] Plugin extraction completes without runtime errors
- [ ] Data fetching uses appropriate caching
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully

### Data Quality Goals
- [ ] All 100 marketplaces display correctly
- [ ] Plugin count reflects actual numbers from manifests
- [ ] Statistics remain accurate and up-to-date
- [ ] Missing data handled with appropriate fallbacks

## üöÄ Next Phase Preview

After completing these tasks, we'll move to:
- Advanced analytics and insights
- Community features (ratings, reviews)
- Automated data refresh scheduling
- Performance monitoring and optimization

---

**Notes:**
- Focus on core functionality first before expanding features
- Test thoroughly with the existing 100 marketplace dataset
- Consider performance implications as we scale beyond 100 marketplaces
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing data structure
