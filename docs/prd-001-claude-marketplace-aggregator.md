# Claude Marketplace Aggregator - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

**Vision:** Create an automated, open-source aggregator that discovers and curates Claude Code marketplaces and plugins from across GitHub, providing a comprehensive directory for the Claude Code ecosystem.

**Mission:** Eliminate friction in plugin discovery by automatically finding marketplaces, validating their plugins, and presenting them in a user-friendly interface with community-driven quality signals.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Fragmented Discovery**: Users must manually search GitHub or fork marketplaces to discover plugins
2. **Manual Curation**: Existing marketplaces require manual PR submissions for new additions
3. **Limited Visibility**: No centralized view of the entire Claude Code plugin ecosystem
4. **No Quality Signals**: Users lack indicators of plugin trustworthiness and quality
5. **Scalability Issues**: Marketplace owners must manually maintain growing plugin lists

### Market Opportunity
The Claude Code ecosystem is rapidly growing with the recent plugin announcement. Early marketplaces are emerging, but there's no unified discovery mechanism. This creates an opportunity for an automated aggregator that serves as the "Google of Claude Code plugins."

## Solution

### Product Description

- Scours GitHub for Claude Code marketplaces and plugins
- Validates plugin structure and safety
- Generates a static website showcasing the ecosystem
- Provides quality signals and community features
- Updates automatically without manual intervention

### Key Differentiators
1. **Fully Automated**: No manual submission process required
2. **Open Source**: Complete transparency in how data is collected and ranked
3. **GitHub Native**: Leverages GitHub's infrastructure for free hosting and CI/CD

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # Every 6 hours
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Scan GitHub for marketplaces
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: npm run scan:marketplaces

      - name: Validate plugins
        run: npm run validate:plugins

      - name: Generate data files
        run: npm run generate:data

      - name: Build website
        run: npm run build

const searchQueries = [
  'filename:.claude-plugin/marketplace.json',
  'topic:claude-code-plugin',
  'topic:claude-marketplace',
  '"claude-code" in:file extension:json'
];

async function searchMarketplaces(): Promise<Marketplace[]> {
  const results = [];

  for (const query of searchQueries) {
    const searchResult = await github.rest.search.repos({
      q: query,
      sort: 'updated',
      per_page: 100
    });

    // Process and deduplicate results
    results.push(...searchResult.data.items);
  }

  return deduplicateAndValidate(results);
}
```
