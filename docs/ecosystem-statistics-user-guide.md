# Ecosystem Statistics User Guide

## 📊 Understanding the Claude Code Plugin Ecosystem

This guide helps you understand and navigate the **Ecosystem Statistics** dashboard, which provides comprehensive insights into the Claude Code plugin ecosystem's growth, health, and developer community.

---

## 🎯 What Are Ecosystem Statistics?

Ecosystem Statistics replace the old "Project Statistics" section to show you:

- **Total ecosystem size** across all marketplaces
- **Growth trends** over time
- **Developer community** health
- **Plugin quality** indicators
- **Category distribution** and trends

Unlike traditional GitHub repository statistics that show data for a single project, ecosystem statistics aggregate data from multiple Claude Code marketplaces and plugin repositories.
