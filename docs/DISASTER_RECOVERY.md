- Monitoring alerts

#### Recovery Steps
1. **Assess Impact** (Time: 5-15 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Check system status
   curl https://claude-marketplace.github.io/aggregator/api/status

   # Verify data integrity
   npm run validate:plugins
   ```

2. **Identify Last Known Good Backup** (Time: 5-10 minutes)
   ```bash
   # List available backups
   npm run backup list

   # Verify backup integrity
   cd backups/daily/backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss
   sha256sum backup-checksum.sha256
   ```

3. **Create Current State Backup** (Time: 10-30 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Backup current corrupted state
   npm run backup backup
   ```

4. **Restore from Backup** (Time: 15-45 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Restore from last good backup
   npm run backup restore backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss
   ```

5. **Validate Recovery** (Time: 10-20 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Validate restored data
   npm run validate:plugins
   npm run generate:data

   # Test website functionality
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

6. **Deploy Fixed Version** (Time: 5-15 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Commit and deploy
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: restore data from backup after corruption"
   git push origin main
   ```

**Total Recovery Time**: 50 minutes - 2.5 hours

### Scenario 2: Complete System Outage

3. **Restore Basic Functionality** (Time: 1-2 hours)
   ```bash
   # Rebuild and redeploy
   npm run build
   npm run deploy

   # If GitHub Pages issues:
   # 1. Check repository settings
   # 2. Verify DNS configuration
   # 3. Consider temporary alternative hosting
   ```

4. **Restore Data Processing** (Time: 2-4 hours)
   ```bash
   # Run full scan pipeline

   # Test API access
   curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
        https://api.github.com/rate_limit
   ```

2. **Implement Mitigation** (Time: 10-30 minutes)
   - Reduce API call frequency
   - Implement exponential backoff
   - Switch to backup authentication method
   - Use cached data where possible

3. **Restore Normal Operations** (Time: 30-60 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Gradually increase scan frequency
   # Monitor rate limits closely
   # Validate data freshness
   ```

**Total Recovery Time**: 45 minutes - 2 hours

### Scenario 4: Security Incident

#### Detection
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Suspicious activity in logs
- Security scanner alerts
- User security reports

#### Recovery Steps
1. **Immediate Containment** (Time: 15-30 minutes)

   - Enable additional monitoring
   - Audit access logs

2. **Assessment & Investigation** (Time: 2-4 hours)
   - Review audit logs
   - Identify compromised systems
   - Assess data exposure
   - Document timeline

3. **Recovery & Hardening** (Time: 4-8 hours)
