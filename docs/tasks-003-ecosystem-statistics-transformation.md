## üìã Project Overview

### üéØ Mission
Transform the current "Project Statistics" section from single-repository GitHub stats into a comprehensive "Ecosystem Statistics" dashboard that showcases the growth, health, and vibrancy of the entire Claude Code plugin ecosystem.

### üöÄ Current State Analysis
- **Current Component:** `GitHubStats.tsx` displays stats for `shrwnsan/claude-marketplace-registry`
- **Current Metrics:** Stars, forks, commits, contributors for single repo
- **Problem:** Doesn't represent the aggregator's true value or ecosystem scope
- **Target Location:** `src/pages/index.tsx:374-389` (Project Statistics section)

### üéØ Desired End State
- **New Component:** `EcosystemStats.tsx` with comprehensive ecosystem metrics
- **New Metrics:** Total plugins, marketplaces, developers, downloads, growth trends
- **Value Proposition:** Clear representation of ecosystem growth and community participation
- **User Benefits:** Better understanding of ecosystem maturity and plugin discovery
